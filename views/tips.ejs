                    <div class="tip">
                        <h5>Tip #1: Keep fasting periods short</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>5:2 fasting:</strong> Restrict your calorie intake for 2 days per week (500 calories per day for cisgender females and 600 for cisgender males).</li>
                            <li><strong>6:1 fasting:</strong> This pattern is similar to the 5:2, but there’s only 1 day of reduced calorie intake instead of 2 days.</li>
                            <li><strong>“Eat Stop Eat”:</strong> A 24-hour complete fast one to two times per week.</li>
                            <li><strong>16:8 fasting:</strong> This pattern involves only consuming food in an 8-hour window and fasting for 16 hours a day, every day of the week.</li>
                            <li><strong>Alternate day fasting:</strong> This involves fasting for 24 hours on alternate days.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h5>Tip #2: Eat a small amount and keep track of calories on fast days</h5>
                        <p><strong>In general, fasting involves the removal of some or all food and drink for a period of time.</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>If you want to try fasting, restricting your calories so that you still eat small amounts on your fast days may be a safer option than doing a full-blown fast.</li>
                            <li>This approach may help reduce some of the risks associated with fasting, such as feeling faint, hungry, and unfocused.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h5>Tip #3: Stay hydrated</h5>
                        <p><strong>It’s vital to drink enough fluid on a fast.</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Most health authorities recommend the 8×8 rule — eight 8-ounce glasses, or just under 2 liters (L) in total, of fluid every day — to stay hydrated.</li>
                            <li>However, the actual amount of fluid you need — although likely in this range — is quite individual.</li>
                            <li>During a fast, many people aim to drink more than 8 cups (2 L) of water over the course of the day.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h5>Tip #4: Stop fasting if you feel unwell</h5>
                        <p><strong>If you do become ill or are concerned about your health, stop fasting.</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>During a fast, you may feel a little tired, hungry, and irritable — but you should never feel unwell.</li>
                            <li>To keep yourself safe, especially if you are new to fasting, consider limiting your fast periods to 24 hours or fewer and keeping a snack on hand in case you start to feel faint or ill.</li>
                        </ul>
